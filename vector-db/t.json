            "o Students describes some ways in which this book and its companion materials can be used to learn this subject most effectively. If you haven't already read it, I urge you to do so before continuing.Anatomy is the study of structure, and physiology is the study of function. These approaches are complementary and never entirely separable. When we study a structure, we want to know, What does it do? Physiology lends meaning to anatomy and, conversely, anatomy is what makes physiology possible. This unity of form and function is an important point to bear in mind as you study the body. Many examples of it will be apparent throughout the book-some of them pointed out for you, and others you will notice for yourself.", 'up the human body. Tissues combine to form structures, and those structures combine to form systems. This chapter sets the stage for your understanding of the new and foreign anatomical terminologies.Anatomy y refers to the study of the structure e of an organism. Physiology is the study of the f function  of the living organism and its parts, as well as the chemical processes involved. Applied anatomy y (also known as clinical anatomy) involves the application of anatomical study for the diagnosis and treatment of disease and surgical procedures. Descriptive anatomy (also known as systemic anatomy) is description of individual parts of the body without reference to disease conditions, viewing the body as a composite of systems that function together.\nGross anatomy y studies structures that are visible without a microscope, while microscopic anatomy y examines structures not visible to the unaided eye. Surface anatomy y (also known as superficial anatomy) studies the form and structure of the surface of the body, especially with reference to the organs beneath the surface (Agur & Dalley,

In this book, we glance\nat hundreds of structures: tissues, organs, organ systems, and points of contact between organ systems. We take a slightly closer look at a few specific tissues and organs. We also cover human  physiology, which is the chemistry and physics of these structures and how they all work together to support the processes of life in each individual. Scientifically Speaking"
